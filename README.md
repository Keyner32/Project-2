## Screen Shots

Have you ever went out for drinks and didn't know what to order? Find yourself getting something completely random and ended up disliking it. Wouldn't you want to know what actually goes into your drinks made at the bar instead saying " What's in this drink ".


## Motivation
Being a young adult I've found myself inexperienced when going out to bars or places to get some drinks with friends or co-workers. I wanted to create an application that would educate the user with popular drinks. These quick information guide to what these drinks were, what was in them, and what other people thought about them. This would help make my decision smarter and happier with what I would received.
